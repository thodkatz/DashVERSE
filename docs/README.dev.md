- [OpenTofu (1.6+) or Terraform (1.6+)]()
- [kubectl (1.28+)]()

If you have Nix installed, all dependencies are provided via `nix develop`.

## Deployment configurations

The deployment settings for both local (testing) and production environments can be found in `terraform/environments` folder.

## Deployment

### Quick Start

1. Start minikube

   **Note:** If you already have a kubernetes cluster, you can skip this step.

   ```shell
   minikube start --cpus='4' --memory='4g'
   ```

1. Deploy the services locally

   ```shell
   just env=local deploy
   ```

1. Verify pods are running

   ```shell
   just status
   ```

1. Do port forwarding for the services to be able to access
   On a `separate terminal` do port forwarding to be able to access the service. Make sure to keep this terminal for the next steps.

   ```shell
   just port-forward
   ```

1. Deploy preconfigured dashboards

   ```shell
   just env=local setup-dashboards
   ```

1. Access services

   Then open:

   - Superset: http://localhost:8088
   - PostgREST API: http://localhost:3000
   - PostgREST API Docs: http://localhost:3001
   - Auth Service: http://localhost:8000
   - Auth Service API Docs: http://localhost:8001
   - Landing site: http://localhost:8080

At this point should have all the configured services and preconfigured dashboards available. You can start adding assessment data to the dashboard.

### Sample Data

To populate the system with sample software and assessments for testing:

```shell
just seed-data
```

The data will appear in the Superset dashboards.

### Credentials

Service credentials are auto-generated during deployment and stored securely in Kubernetes secrets. To retrieve them:

```shell
just show-access
```

This displays:

- PostgreSQL connection details
- Superset admin login

You can also retrieve individual credentials with kubectl:

```shell
# PostgreSQL password
kubectl get secret dashverse-secrets -n dashverse -o jsonpath='{.data.postgres-password}' | base64 -d

# Superset admin password
kubectl get secret dashverse-secrets -n dashverse -o jsonpath='{.data.superset-admin-password}' | base64 -d
```

### Justfile Recipes

> Run `just --list` at any time to see all available recipes with descriptions.
> To override a default variable (such as `env=local`), put the assignment **before** the recipe name: `just env=production deploy`.

### Manual Deployment

```shell
cd terraform
tofu init
tofu apply -var-file="environments/local.tfvars"
```

### Production Deployment

```shell
# Deploy all services (builds images and applies Terraform)
just env=production deploy

# Populate data
just sync-apply
just seed-data

# Configure Superset dashboards
just env=production setup-dashboards
```

The production configuration (`terraform/environments/production.tfvars`) includes settings for external URLs used in iframe embedding.

### Sync EVERSE Data

Indicators and dimensions are synced from the EVERSE repository:
https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/indicators

The sync runs automatically daily at 2am via a CronJob. To trigger manually:

```shell
just sync-trigger
```

Or to sync outside the cluster:

```shell
just sync-apply
```

### Authentication

The Auth Service provides a web interface for user registration and JWT token generation.

1. Open http://localhost:8000 (after port-forward)
2. Register a new account
3. Login and generate an API token
4. Use the token for PostgREST write access

Alternatively, generate a token via CLI (register a user first):

```shell
just jwt <username> <password>
```

### API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is provided using [Scalar](https://scalar.com/):

- **PostgREST API Docs**: http://localhost:3001 - Database REST interface with all available endpoints
- **Auth Service API Docs**: http://localhost:8001 - Authentication endpoints for user management and JWT tokens

The documentation is automatically generated from OpenAPI specifications and includes an interactive request builder.

### Dashboard Configuration

After deployment, configure Superset with pre-built dashboards using Ansible:

```shell
just setup-dashboards
```

This creates five role-based dashboards based on [RSQKit roles](https://everse.software/RSQKit/your_role):

- **[Policy Maker](https://everse.software/RSQKit/policy_maker)** - High-level adoption and compliance overview
- **[Principal Investigator](https://everse.software/RSQKit/principal_investigator)** - Project-level metrics and action items
- **[Research Software Engineer](https://everse.software/RSQKit/research_software_engineer)** - Technical metrics and detailed check results
- **[Researcher Who Codes](https://everse.software/RSQKit/researcher_who_codes)** - Practical guidance and quick improvements
- **[Trainer](https://everse.software/RSQKit/trainer)** - Training insights and best practices

Prerequisites:

- Ansible (2.9+)
- Port forwarding running (`just port-forward`)
- Superset accessible at localhost:8088

The Superset admin password is automatically retrieved from Kubernetes secrets during setup.


## Documentation

- `docs/Kubernetes.md` – operational commands for managing the Minikube deployment.
- `docs/Database.md` – details of the PostgreSQL schema, assessment mapping, and populate script usage.
- `docs/API_examples.md` – practical PostgREST calls, including the multi-step workflow for creating assessments.

## Clean up

Remove all deployed resources:

```shell
just destroy
```

Delete the resources and the minikube cluster:

```shell
just destroy-all
```
